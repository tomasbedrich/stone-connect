- **Type safety** - Full type hints and data validation
- **Easy integration** - Simple context manager interface
- **Robust error handling** - Detailed exception hierarchy
- **Well tested** - Comprehensive test suite with high coverage

## Supported Operations

- 🌡️ **Temperature Control** - Set target temperature and read current values
- 🔥 **Operation Modes** - Manual, Comfort, Eco, Antifreeze, Schedule, Boost, and power modes
- 📅 **Schedule Information** - Read weekly heating schedules
- 📊 **Status Monitoring** - Heater status and sensor readings
- ℹ️ **Device Information** - Hardware details, firmware version, network info

## Installation

```bash
pip install stone-connect
```

### Development Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tomasbedrich/stone-connect.git
cd stone-connect
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

## Quick Start

```python
import asyncio
from stone_connect import StoneConnectHeater, OperationMode

async def main():
    # Connect to your heater (replace with your heater's IP)
    async with StoneConnectHeater("192.168.1.100") as heater:
        # Get device information
        info = await heater.get_info()
        print(f"Connected to: {info.appliance_name}")
        
        # Get current status
        status = await heater.get_status()
        print(f"Current temperature: {status.current_temperature}°C")
        print(f"Target temperature: {status.set_point}°C")
        
        # Set temperature to 22°C in manual mode
        await heater.set_temperature(22.0, OperationMode.MANUAL)
        
        # Switch to comfort mode
        await heater.set_operation_mode(OperationMode.COMFORT)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```
